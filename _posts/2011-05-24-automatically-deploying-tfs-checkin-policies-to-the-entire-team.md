I stumbled across [this great post](http://www.codewrecks.com/blog/index.php/2010/12/04/distributing-visual-studio-addin-for-the-team/) showing how you can use the TFS Power Tools to automatically deploy your custom TFS check-in policies to everyone on your team in Visual Studio 2010.&#160; It&#8217;s so awesome I had to share.
