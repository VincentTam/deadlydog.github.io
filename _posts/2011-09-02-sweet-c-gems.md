[James Michael Hare](http://geekswithblogs.net/BlackRabbitCoder/Default.aspx) has a lot of awesome C# and .Net related posts, so this is just a little shout out to him (and my own little way of bookmarking his blogs since GWB doesn&#8217;t provide a way to "favourite" or "follow" him).&#160; Of particular awesomeness is his [C#/.NET Little Wonders and Pitfalls](http://geekswithblogs.net/BlackRabbitCoder/archive/2011/08/11/c.net-little-wonders--pitfalls-the-complete-collection-so-far.aspx) series, and the [C#/.NET Fundamentals: Choosing the Right Collection Class](http://geekswithblogs.net/BlackRabbitCoder/archive/2011/06/16/c.net-fundamentals-choosing-the-right-collection-class.aspx "C#/.NET Fundamentals: Choosing the Right Collection Class").&#160; Keep the great posts coming James!
