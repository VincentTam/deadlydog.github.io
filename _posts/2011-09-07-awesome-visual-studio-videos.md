I watched an awesome Channel 9 [Visual Studio Tips And Tricks video](http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/TechEd/NorthAmerica/2011/DEV305), so I thought I&#8217;d share.&#160; Some great VS gems in there.&#160; Even a few Windows 7 ones, like using Alt+D to jump to the address bar in Windows Explorer, and typing "cmd" in the Windows Explorer address bar to open a command prompt at the current directory.

Also, if you&#8217;re interested in what the next Visual Studio release has in store, [check out this Channel 9 video](http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/TechEd/NorthAmerica/2011/DEV326).
