With the ability to extend Visual Studio 2010, lots of great extensions have popped up.&#160; These not only increase productivity, but make the whole coding experience much nicer.&#160; To find and install extensions, in Visual Studio just go to Tools -> Extension Manager.&#160; Here&#8217;s a list of my favorites:

&#8211; [PowerCommands for Visual Studio 2010](http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/e5f41ad9-4edc-4912-bca3-91147db95b99/) &#8211; tons of features.

&#8211; [Productivity Power Tools](http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/d0d33361-18e2-46c0-8ff2-4adea1e34fef/) &#8211; tons of features.

&#8211; Regex Editor &#8211; Quickly test your regular expressions to make sure they match all of your cases, and save them for future use. Also provides some common regex&#8217;s by default.&#160; Automatically pops up as soon as you type "Regex r = new ".

&#8211; Search Work Items for TFS 2010 &#8211; If you&#8217;re using TFS this one is a must have; it allows you to easily do a text search on all work items.

&#8211; [Snippet Designer](http://snippetdesigner.codeplex.com/) &#8211; If you create snippets, this provides a great GUI; much better than writing out all of the xml.

&#8211; [Spell Checker](http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/7c8341f1-ebac-40c8-92c2-476db8d523ce) &#8211; Simple spell checker.&#160; Great for fixing spelling mistakes in comments.&#160; Automatically knows to ignore variable names, etc.

&#8211; [VSCommands 2010](http://vscommands.com/features/) &#8211; tons of features.
