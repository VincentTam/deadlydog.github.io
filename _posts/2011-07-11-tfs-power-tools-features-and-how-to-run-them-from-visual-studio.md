There are a few great features in the [TFS Power Tools](http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/c255a1e4-04ba-4f68-8f4e-cd473d6b971f) that I wasn't aware of, such as TreeDiff which let's you compare folders (or even entire branches) to see the differences between them, and Undo Unchanged which undoes files that are checked out, but don't have any changes made to them, so that they don't appear in the Pending Changes window. [This blog](http://duncanjasmith.blogspot.com/2007/05/using-team-foundation-server-power.html) explains some of the features, and [this one](http://www.aaubry.net/undo-checkout-on-unchanged-files-%28tfs%29.aspx) shows how to add the console-app-only features as External Tools in Visual Studio to easily run them from Visual Studio. Very cool!
