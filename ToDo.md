# List of things to still do to the blog

- Fix up all build errors and warnings.
  - `Invalid theme folder: _sass` build warning is a bug in Jekyll: https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/issues/7630
- Make sure tags are all on separate lines in Front Matter on all posts.
- Convert all ‘ and ’ and `&#8216;` and `&rsquo;` characters to ', but do them one by one as it seems to mess up some posts.
- Convert all &amp;lt; and &amp;gt; to `<` and `>`.
- Remove unnecessary front matter attributes from all posts. e.g. `jabber_published`, `tagazine-media`, `guid`, `id`
- Maybe add `Email` option to my bio links.
- Add Google Analytics integration.
- Add advertisements.
- Add comment support.
  - If possible, migrate comments from WordPress. Might just need to do it manually.
