# List of things to still do to the blog

- Fix up all build errors and warnings.
  - `Invalid theme folder: _sass` build warning is a bug in Jekyll: https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/issues/7630
- Add Google Analytics integration.
  - Added, but still need to test and verify it, but can't do that until actually on the blog.danskingdom.com URL.
- Add advertisements.
  - Added, but they don't show up yet, possibly because they're not actually on the blog.danskingdom.com URL yet.
- Add comment support.
  - Tutorials: https://mademistakes.com/articles/jekyll-static-comments/ and https://mademistakes.com/articles/improving-jekyll-static-comments/
  - If possible, migrate comments from WordPress. Might just need to do it manually.
