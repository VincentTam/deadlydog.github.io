# List of things to still do to the blog

- Go through and update all posts to use proper markdown and get rid of html. Will go through posts oldest to newest.
  - Currently processing page: 2012-09-14-sql-server-script-commands-to-check-if-object-exists-and-drop-it.m
- Search for `160;` and just `0;` to make sure none were missed that need to be fixed up.
- Fix up all build errors and warnings.
- Convert tabs to 4 spaces in all posts for less indentation in the final result.
- Maybe convert all double spaces after a period to single spaces.
- Maybe convert all ** to __ for bold in all posts.
- Remove unnecessary front matter attributes from all posts. e.g. `jabber_published`, `tagazine-media`, `guid`, `id`
- Maybe add `Email` option to my bio links.
- Add Google Analytics integration.
- Add advertisements.
- Add comment support.
  - If possible, migrate comments from WordPress. Might just need to do it manually.
