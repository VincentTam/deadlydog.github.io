# List of things to still do to the blog

- Go through and update all posts to use proper markdown and get rid of html. Will go through posts oldest to newest.
  - Last processed page: 2011-04-17-adding-valuechanged-events-to-dependency-objects-in-wpf.md
- Fix up all build errors and warnings.
- Add Google Analytics integration.
- Add advertisements.
- Add comment support.
  - If possible, migrate comments from WordPress. Might just need to do it manually.
