# List of things to still do to the blog

- Go through and update all posts to use proper markdown and get rid of html. Will go through posts oldest to newest.
  - Currently processing page: 2012-09-10-autohotkey-cannot-interact-with-windows-8-windowsor-can-it.md
- Fix up all build errors and warnings.
- Remove unnecessary front matter attributes from all posts. e.g. `jabber_published`
- Maybe add `Email` option to my bio links.
- Add Google Analytics integration.
- Add advertisements.
- Add comment support.
  - If possible, migrate comments from WordPress. Might just need to do it manually.
