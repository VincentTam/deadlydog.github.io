message: "This is really well done.  I've been rolling my own implementation of the same kind of setup using my own AHK scripts and the aging Slickrun (http://www.bayden.com/slickrun/).  I had thoughts of creating my own program like this before - and yours seems to have a lot of great ideas.\r\n\r\nThere are a couple of little things about the program that, in my opinion, could help.\r\n1. Settings option to change the hotkey used. (Capslock for me moves the current window to the next monitor)\r\n2. Support for Windows key commands - Win + Shift + Right to move the window to another monitor (Specifically my capslock key can't move the window)\r\n3. Opening Location\r\n   A. Be able to set the default position where to open (Such as 0,0) in the settings\r\n   B. Open to the monitor where the cursor currently is\r\n4. Maybe include an alternate gui mode where the autocomplete window pops up like Intellisense in Visual Studio and the program is just a one line app (more akin to Slickrun).\r\n\r\nThose are just a few ideas I've had initially.  I really really like the foundation you have, and some of the supplied commands are really smart (like the URL shortener).  Whats more, thanks for sharing the source so I may play around and look to add some of the above changes I mentioned. Thanks for sharing this!"
