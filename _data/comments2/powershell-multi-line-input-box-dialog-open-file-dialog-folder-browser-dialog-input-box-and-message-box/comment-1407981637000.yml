message: "<a href=\"#comment-123476\" rel=\"nofollow\">@DemoD </a> \r\nThe only one that does not pop in the foreground for me is the Read-FolderBrowserDialog, and unfortunately I haven't been able to find a way to force it.  Luckily though it does create a new window icon in the start menu bar, so it's at least a little obvious that a new popup was created and requires attention.  If I do find a method that does it, I'll update the post."
