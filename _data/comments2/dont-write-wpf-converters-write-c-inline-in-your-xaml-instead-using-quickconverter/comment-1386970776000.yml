message: "Great write up Dan! \r\n\r\nI have a couple things to add. First, there is also a markup extension named qc:QuickConverter that can be used to fill out a converter property. I find I actually prefer it to using qc:Binding. For example, you could create a standard binding and set the converter using this markup. This is particularly useful if you create any of your own markup extensions that want to make use of converters. I've actually found myself creating markup for setting filters on lists and using QuickConverter to write the filter logic in the Xaml.\r\n\r\nSecond, qc:Binding, qc:MultiBinding, and qc:QuickConverter all have properties named V0-V9. These properties are statically set using traditional markup. They can then be accessed as $V0-$V9. This allows you to use other markup like StaticResource (or anything custom that you write).\r\n\r\nDebugging the actual logic you write is unfortunately not likely to happen. I generate the converters using expression trees, which can not be debugged in that way. I only way this may be possible is if I generated an equivalent method in traditional code that you could step through. This would dramatically increase load times (although they may still be negligible). Maybe I could make this a run time switch. Maybe for QuickConverter 2.0 (if that ever happens).\r\n\r\nThanks for writing this up!\r\nJohannes Moersch"
