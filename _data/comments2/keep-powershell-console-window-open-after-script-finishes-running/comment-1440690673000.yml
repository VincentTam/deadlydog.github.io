If not, the .reg file will add it I believe and may still work. Otherwise you may just have to do a Find in your registry for \"powershell.exe\" and find the equivalent key.\r\n\r\nFor #2 you should just need to include \"-NoExit\" in the ProcessStartInfo.Arguments.  Also, you may need to toggle the UseShellExecute property as well; I can never remember if we want it to be true or false."
