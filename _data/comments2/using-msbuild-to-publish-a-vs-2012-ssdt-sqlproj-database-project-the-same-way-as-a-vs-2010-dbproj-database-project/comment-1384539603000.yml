  Hi Daniel. Thanks for detailed information on this topic. However, I've
  managed to get one strange problem after I've recreated your solution on my
  side. If my connection string is specified using IntegratedSecurity=True, then
  during the build I get "Unable to connect to target server" error, but if I
  specify user/password in the connection string - it works perfectly fine. Have
  you seen anything like this? Thanks in advance!
