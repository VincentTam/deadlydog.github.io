message: "It's a good idea, but it would be waaay overkill for me.  I would literally sit for 5 mins calculating my password for service X before I could remember it and that would mean I just cba to login at all unless it was something work-related I got paid for.\r\n\r\nA good long family of passwords containing members of the 4 big families(small letters, capital letters, specials and numbers) is enough for me.  They are all related to a fantasy character name I only used in PnP roleplaying 20 yrs ago and that is utterly unique to me, unless someone was my childhood friend, which narrows it down to about 3 people on earth.\r\n\r\nYour points are all valid, it's not that; It just feels like SO much hassle and work for so little gain.  I mean, if I had truely career-wrecking info on accounts that I wanted to keep, an old offline computer with offline backup drives stored in different geo locations would be better.\r\n\r\nSo how do YOU remember all this hassle and how long does it take you to calculate all the passwords?...\r\nCan you really be bothered in the long run and do you really never use lesser important services with \"Remember me\" cookies?\r\n\r\nThanks for a great blog btw, I follow you via RSS and it's usually high quality reading, just wanted to get that out there too."
