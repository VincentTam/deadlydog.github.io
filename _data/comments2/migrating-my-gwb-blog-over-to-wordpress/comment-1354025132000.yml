  Sorry to see you leave GWB. I was just hired as the site developer/community
  builder 2 weeks ago and we're going to try to make things better. 


  Some things at the top of our list are:

  - Building some nicer templates (I've been working on this for the last week)

  - Adding a code editor to posts 

  - Adding categories to feeds


  Let me know if you have any other suggestions or if there's anything we could
  do to make you come back!
