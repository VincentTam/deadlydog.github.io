message: "Hello Ben;\r\n\r\nI've only recently signed up for a blog at GWB and although I now have a blog I must say I'm a little confused and may end up disappointed, here's why.\r\n\r\nI cannot find any forum for me to discuss the site, ask questions or assist others. Its a major omission to not have a forum.\r\n\r\nI can see links here and there for \"feedback forum\" and so on, but clicking these takes me to the sales page for \"Uservoice\" so the link is an advertisement not a forum at all.\r\n\r\nThe consider the site's search features - its just a single text box!\r\n\r\nI cannot refine my search at all, I can't for example search blog user names or blog titles or post titles.\r\n\r\nI have no idea what search actually searches - all text? only tags? all posts? all posts + their titles etc etc etc.\r\n\r\nIf I wanted to find posts whose title contained \"optimize\" then I'm stuck I cannot see any way to do that.\r\n\r\nAlso the results of a search cannot be ordered in any way, I'd like to order the results by date-posted for example or by number of comments that post has attracted but I simply cannot.\r\n\r\nI can make suggestions but this feels like a waste of time, I have no idea who looks at these I cant find a neat tabulated list either, all I can see is the long winded wordy list on the suggestions page, a proper condensed line by line list (like a spreadsheet) would be most helpful for me to scroll through, people would pay more attention if the list were presented in that way.\r\n\r\nAlso an ability to search the suggestions would be neat.\r\n\r\nIt just strikes me as a load of low hanging fruit is being neglected and left to rot on the branches, there's so much simple stuff that could be done..\r\n\r\nSorry to hijack your post Daniel but I couldn't resist!\r\n\r\nThanks"
