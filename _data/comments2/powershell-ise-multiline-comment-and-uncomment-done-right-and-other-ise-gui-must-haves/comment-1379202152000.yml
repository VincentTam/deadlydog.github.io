message: "Excellent add-on.\r\n\r\nThe unofficial practice for the past several years has been for MS to continually leave certain features, sometimes very basic ones (e.g. Notepad's continued absence of a 'wrap around' search), out of their products for the sole purpose of giving 3rd-party developers something to make and/or sell. Not sure if that's the case here but I wouldn't be surprised at all if so."
