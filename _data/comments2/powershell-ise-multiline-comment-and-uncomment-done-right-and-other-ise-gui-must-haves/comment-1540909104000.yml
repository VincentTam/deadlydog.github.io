message: "Thanks, I wanted the same functionality as in NP++ (CTRL+Q to comment / uncomment based on the 1st line being a commented line or not.) \r\n\r\nI was able to change this code to correctly mirror that functionality. :)  Also, this code seems a little dense, I'm sure there is room to reduce the code further just checking on the functions I needed to modify."
