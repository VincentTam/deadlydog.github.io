message: "<a href=\"#comment-13029\" rel=\"nofollow\">@Carl Reid </a> \r\nI confirmed a hunch I had that the error you were seeing arose when using \"Set-StrictMode -Version Latest\" in the script.  I typically use this in my scripts, but wasn't using it when I did my testing.\r\n\r\nI've updated my code to simply check for $null instead of trying to check .Length, so the problem is fixed and it is still nice and concise :)\r\n\r\nThanks."
