  So I found a problem, when running the powershell script with Administrative
  permissions (i.e. Run As Admin), it will not wait for user input at the end of
  the script. Placing -NoExit as part of the argument list works, but then quite
  obviously after the you press any queue, Powershell does not exit. :) If I run
  my script without Administrative permissions, then the code you provided above
  will wait for user input. My question is, how do I get this to work with
  Administraive permissions? It is useful to be able to capture error messages
  (if any).
