I'm guessing that it just doesn't delete the files, and that you simply need to also provide the -Force switch to Get-ChildItem, otherwise hidden and read-only files won't be found and passed to the Remove-Item cmdlet.  So basically you want to use this:\r\n\r\nPowerShell “& Get-ChildItem * -Include *.xxx -Recurse -Force | Remove-Item -Force”\r\n\r\nI hope that helps. If you still need an answer I suggest posting your question with more detail on Stack Overflow or the PowerShell.org forums, as there are many others there who are smarter than I who can likely help you out :)"
