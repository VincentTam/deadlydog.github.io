  [&#8230;] I&#8217;ve created a PowerShell 2.0 compatible module that uses the
  native Windows OS commands to zip and unzip files in a synchronous manner.
  This works on older OSs, like Windows XP, and does not require .Net 4.5 or any
  other external tools. The functions will also block script execution until the
  files have all been zipped/unzipped. You can find more information and the
  module on my blog here. [&#8230;]
