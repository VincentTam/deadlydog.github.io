  Hi Gal, what is the command line that you are using to try and run
  Invoke-MsBuild (i.e. how are you calling it and with what parameters)?  Also,
  if you could create a new issue for this at
  https://invokemsbuild.codeplex.com/workitem/list/basic that would be great, as
  others may experience the same problem as you, and we can go back and forth
  there without cluttering up the comments on this post.  Thanks.
