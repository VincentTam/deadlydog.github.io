message: "Hello,\r\n\r\nThanks for this post - I've happily plundered your code :-)\r\n\r\nI was wondering if you would be able to add to it and show how to read/write to a SharePoint library of xml files. As far as I know the get-content won't work. I've been trying SPFile.OpenBinary() and OpenBinaryStream() which have read ok, but still no luck saving. My situation is concerns a library of InfoPath form data - stored as xml - which I need to bulk amend.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nJohn"
