  Thanks for the great how-to. I almost have it all working but keep getting a
  build failure for an incorrect AssemblyVersion. I tracked this to using the
  %2a in the version number (fails when making this change in VS2017). I wonder
  if the syntax for version # and revision # in the .proj file changed? Have you
  run into this issue?
