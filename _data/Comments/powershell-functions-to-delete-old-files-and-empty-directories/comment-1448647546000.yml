message: "Thank you. I spent a few days playing with this function thing you revealed to me and today I'm putting the finishing touches on my magnum opus of a backup script that handles two different vm environments, moves things to tape and removes the oldest backups to make room for new ones. \r\n\r\nThank you again for sharing this wonderful creation."
