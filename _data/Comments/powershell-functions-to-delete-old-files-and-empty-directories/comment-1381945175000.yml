I've created your sample scenario, as well as empty directories up to 5 levels deep and everything works fine for me.  What version of PowerShell are you using? I'm using v3.0. If you are using a lower version maybe that is the problem.\r\n\r\nThanks for posting your modified solution though in case anybody else runs into the same problem."
