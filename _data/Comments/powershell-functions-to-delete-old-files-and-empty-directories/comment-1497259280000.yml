message: "Great script thanks but when trying to use a wildcard with the path parameter it doesn't want to work as expected. \r\n\r\ne.g I have the path \"C:\\Temp\\Applications\\New Folder\" &amp; \"New Folder(2)\". This is just a test for a similar but much larger folder hierarchy I'll be using in the live environment.\r\n\r\nUsing the following command it only removes the second folder contents but without the wildcard it checks all folders: \r\n\r\nRemove-FilesCreatedBeforeDate -Path \"C:\\Temp\\Applications\\New*\" -DateTime ((Get-Date).AddDays(-0)) -Whatif -OutputDeletedPaths\r\n\r\nAm I missing something?"
