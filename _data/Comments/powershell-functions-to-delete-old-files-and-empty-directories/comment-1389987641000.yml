  It would seem there is a potential race condition in your script to remove old
  files when used to cleanup something like a server output directory.
  Specifically, if an application creates an empty directory newer than the
  CreatedBeforeDate or NotModifiedAfterDate and your Remove-Files... script
  finds it before the application writes a file in the directory, the directory
  will be deleted and will potentially leave the application broken. IMO, the
  date of the directory should be checked to meet the CreatedBeforeDate or
  NotModifiedAfterDate criteria to qualify for deletion.
