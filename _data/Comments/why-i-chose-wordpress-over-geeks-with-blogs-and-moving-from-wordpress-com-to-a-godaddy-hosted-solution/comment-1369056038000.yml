message: "Hey DeadlyDog,\r\n\r\nI'm sorry you moved away from GeeksWithBlogs and I understand some of your frustrations. \r\n\r\nI noticed you said you can't really see the difference at GeeksWithBlogs since we hired some developers (me! :). We did launch a new homepage just 2 weeks ago and moved the entire site to Azure. You may not have noticed this though since many bloggers don't visit the homepage anymore. We're also building out some new templates for individual blogs (in addition to our new \"Minimal\" template that you may not know about), but it's going to be a few more weeks for those to be completed. You can check out the minimal template on my own blog at http://geekswithblogs.net/BenBarreth. \r\n\r\nNow that you've moved away, I doubt you'll move back, and truly I wish you all the best. The WordPress platform is outstanding and we've certainly got our work cut out for us at GWB competing with that. \r\n\r\nKeep up the good blogging!\r\n\r\nBen Barreth\r\nGeeksWithBlogs Developer and Community Developer"
