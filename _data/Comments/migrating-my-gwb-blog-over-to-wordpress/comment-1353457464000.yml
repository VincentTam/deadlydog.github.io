  Wordpress is definitely tempting. Have you looked the wordpress mobile app yet
  on the wp store? It is the perfect way to create quick posts and manage
  comments. 


  I am planning to move to wordpress too. By the way, I'd be interested if you
  find a theme that spans the entire estate. AFAIK this has been disabled to
  optimize mobile/tablet rendering.
