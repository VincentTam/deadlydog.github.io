  Strange, the code in my .sqlproj file is exactly as it appears on the
  website.  Maybe when you copied it over it copied the text funny; I find after
  I copy text from a website and paste it in an editor I often have to go delete
  the copied double quotes and re-enter a regular double quote in it's place.
