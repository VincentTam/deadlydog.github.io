message: "Hi.\r\n\r\nI was wondering if I could deploy my Database project by Building or Re-Building by solution (which contains other projects) from within Visual Studio 2012. I want to build project so that I can run unit tests *after* the build process triggered the localdb deploy to deploy any changes. Is this even possible? thanks!"
