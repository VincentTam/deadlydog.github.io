message: "Just fyi, Shift-Tab reverses through the tab completion list (goes backwards after pressing Tab first. eg, Type \"Get-\" then press Tab a few times. Now press Shift-Tab and the auto-completion will back up to the previous option each time you press it.\r\n\r\nIt's useful when you Tab too quick and go past the option you wanted."
