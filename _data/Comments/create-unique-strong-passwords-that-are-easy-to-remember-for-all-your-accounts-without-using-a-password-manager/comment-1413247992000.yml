You make a great point and are right that for probably 85% of the websites I've created an account on, I don't really care about that account and don't have any real or sensitive info on it.  For those I just stick to using a generic strong password that is shared for all of them.  It's that other 15% though where this technique comes in very handy. I'm sure you have 10 or 15 accounts that have sensitive information on them, or that you really don't want somebody else to get access to. It's those account where this technique is very beneficial; you don't end up sharing one or two strong passwords between all of them, and don't have to try and remember 10 or 15 different strong passwords. For those people that are super paranoid, they can use this technique to generate unique passwords for EVERY account they create, but for myself and practicality's sake, I only use this technique for the subset of accounts that I truly care about. I should have had a blurb about this in the article itself. Thanks :)"
