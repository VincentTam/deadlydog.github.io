message: "(This is a rant-style blog comment, please be careful.)\r\n\r\nPowershell ISE for PS v3 is a broken toy.\r\nIt lacks so many things even a standard text editor knows how to do.\r\n\r\nIt crashs for heavy debugging sessions.\r\nIt uses multi-tab rows which switch position if you activate tabs (now debug code, which uses 3 external scripts and try to find any script-tab in that switching and blinking tab-bar (what the hell!?).\r\nIt sometimes shows wrong or no variable content on mouse over.\r\nIt sometimes does not CTRL-X, just does nothing.\r\nTry the undo/redo.. if you make use of it too often, your code is scrambled!\r\nYou cannot execute code, which sets the cursor around or reads keystrokes in the console. \r\nYou will not get line number and exact error, if your code in a scriptblock fails, which has been added to a PSObject. \r\nCurrent script directory is not used when opening new files. \r\nThe replace and find fails when used in word-only mode.\r\nWhere is the keyword highliting? \r\nThe search, already mention here, is just a total disaster!\r\nCTRL-Tab cycles through all tabs, who makes use of that? CTRL-Tab needs to switch to the previous tab and back again!\r\nTabs are not closable before activation.\r\nBreakpoints sometimes just get stuck and invisible, no way to remove.\r\nThe ISE won't reload or notify on external changes to a script and even worse, it executes the externally modified version instead of whats shown on screen! So the ISE is not only a pita for day to day use, it's dangerous to use as well!\r\n\r\nI have a list of 20 more issues for the ISE.\r\n\r\nThis thing is the worst scripting environment I've used for years. Please Microsoft take a look at your very own VisualStudio. A minified version of that is what I expect from the Powershell-ISE in terms of editing/debugging and look and feel for the GUI. \r\n\r\nThere are wtf-topics related to the powershell syntax as well, but I'll move on now. Thanks for reading and @deadlydog:\r\n\r\nNice to meet you! You're the first person I encounter on the net, who shows the world, what the ISE is really about, congrats!"
