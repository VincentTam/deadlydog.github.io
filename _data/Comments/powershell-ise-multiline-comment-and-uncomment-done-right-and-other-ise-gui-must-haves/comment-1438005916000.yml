  Hi there. One problem with the code appears when there is no state saved and
  one wants to load it. One gets a nasty error then. I have changed the code to
  accommodate the fact that $filename in the Import-IseState could not exist
  yet. Just Test-Path and if it's $false, don't do anything and output a message
  onto the console that says a state has not yet been saved and there is nothing
  to load. Cheers. Best regards, Darek.
