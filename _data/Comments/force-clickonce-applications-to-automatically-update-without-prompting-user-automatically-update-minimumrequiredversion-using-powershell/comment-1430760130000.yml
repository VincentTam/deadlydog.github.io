message: "This was perfect, thank you for spending time on this and providing it. The Conflicting File Mod dialog is a pain, but so is closing multiple files in VS.  Because the tab width is based on the file name, I curse MS every time I need to close tabs for not providing a \"Close All\" function.  Perhaps there's a NuGet for that too...lol\r\n\r\nCheers!"
