message: "Hi, I realize this post is old but I had a question. I wrote this .bat file to run a PowerShell script that's saved in the same folder. I've tried a few different ways to make sure PowerShell stays open but so far it doesn't work. The PowerShell script itself runs on my local PC but is remotely starting a process on a VM. Here's what I have:\r\n\r\n@ECHO OFF\r\nSET ThisScriptsDirectory=%~dp0\r\nSET PowerShellScriptPath=%ThisScriptsDirectory%Stage_1st_Half.ps1\r\nPowerShell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command \"&amp; 'PowerShellScriptPath'\";\r\n\r\nI've tried the above with the following at the end:\r\n\r\nif ($Host.Name -eq \"ConsoleHost\")\r\n{\r\n    Write-Host \"Press any key to continue...\"\r\n    $Host.UI.RawUI.ReadKey(\"NoEcho,IncludeKeyUp\") &gt; $null\r\n}\r\n\r\nAnd also\r\n\r\nRead-Host -Prompt “Press Enter to exit”\r\n\r\nBut each time I run it the window opens and flashes closed. I don't have admin privileges (and won't be able to get them) on my work PC and my goal for this is to make running these PowerShell scripts easier for my less tech-savvy teammates who need to run this process at certain times, without them calling me to help them out at 10pm on a maintenance evening. I'm definitely not an expert coder but am trying to learn more and teach myself as much as I can. Do you have any ideas why I can't get the PowerShell window to stay open? Thank you for your assistance."
