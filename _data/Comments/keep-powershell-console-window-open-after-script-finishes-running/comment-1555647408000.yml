  Try the following:

  SET ThisScriptsDirectory=%~dp0

  SET PowerShellScriptPath=%ThisScriptsDirectory%\Stage_1st_Half.ps1

  PowerShell -NoExit -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "&amp;
  '%PowerShellScriptPath%'"


  You seemed to be missing the following in your code block:
    * a backslash after %ThisScriptsDirectory% (2nd line)
    * -NoExit option after PowerShell (3rd line)
    * %s around PowerShellScriptPath (3rd line)
    * single quotes need to surround %PowerShellScriptPath% - the first one looks like a backtick (`) and not a single quote (') (3rd line)
