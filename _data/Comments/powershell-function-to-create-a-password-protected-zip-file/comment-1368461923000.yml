  Thanks for the comment.  I chose to implement it as zip purely for
  compatibility reasons, as Windows can now handle .zip files natively, and not
  everybody knows what a .7z file is.  I've updated the function to take the
  compression type as a parameter, so it's easy to specify to make a 7z file
  now; zip is still the default though.  Thanks :)
