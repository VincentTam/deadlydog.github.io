  Thanks for the insight.  We use a generic 'install.cmd' wrapper for all of our
  installs so it would really be nice to be able to use one standard script for
  everything that detects the current path if run from a mapped drive - no
  modifications wherever it is run from.  The other reason that you mentioned is
  also a concern - that the script will break if the UNC path changes if hard
  coded.  I think I'm close at getting it going based on the link in the
  previous post.  It seems to detect the UNC path from a mapped drive nicely. 
  This would cover us if the script was run from a mapped drive or not.
