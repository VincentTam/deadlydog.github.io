  hi


  sorry, i'm a noob and have a powershell script that i want a non admin user to
  be able to double click a batch file to run. i've followed the instructions
  and it works fine for my domain admin account, but two things keep stopping it
  from working for a non admin account. if i run the ps1 file, it gives me an
  access denied error. if i run my batch file it asks for admin credentials.
  i've added -Verb RunAs}";  but it's still not working.


  hoping someone can help point me in the right direction!


  thanks
