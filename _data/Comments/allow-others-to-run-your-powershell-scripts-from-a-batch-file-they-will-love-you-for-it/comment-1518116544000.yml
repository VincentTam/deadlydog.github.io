  Hello.  I am following your example of calling PowerShell from PowerShell to
  use -Verb RunAs.  When the second Powershell starts, I get a dialog box that
  asks "Do you want to allow this app to make changes to your device?" - Windows
  Power Shell.  I have to hit Yes or No.  I am an admin on this PC but I want my
  users to run this who are not admins.  Is there anyway to suppress that dialog
  for admins and non-admins?
