message: "<a href=\"#comment-67138\" rel=\"nofollow\">@deadlydog  </a> \r\nThanks for the reply.  I'll take your advice and post on Stack Overflow.\r\n\r\nI tried both suggestions and they don't error out but they don't create the groups either so I'm not sure what is going on. When I run them, it just echoes the command back to me. I also never see the Active Directory Module being loaded.  I think it has something to do with the curly braces because when I remove them the AD Module loads but I get the error shown below.  I just started learning about Powershell so I'm still not clear on the specifics of when to use {,\",',or[.\r\nI also tried running the command directly without using the variables in my post above but get the same error. Its something related to running from the cmd line though as I can run it in powershell succesfully. \r\nHere is the error I get when I run without the curly braces.\r\nNew-ADGroup : Cannot convert 'System.Object[]' to the type 'System.String'\r\nrequired by parameter 'Path'. Specified method is not supported.\r\nAt line:1 char:110\r\n+ ... e Global -path OU=Groups,OU=Branch1\r\n,OU=Test,DC=Test1,DC=Test2,DC=Test3,DC=com -Des ...\r\n+                    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n    + CategoryInfo          : InvalidArgument: (:) [New-ADGroup], ParameterBin\r\n   dingException\r\n    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : CannotConvertArgument,Microsoft.ActiveDirectory.\r\n   Management.Commands.NewADGroup"
