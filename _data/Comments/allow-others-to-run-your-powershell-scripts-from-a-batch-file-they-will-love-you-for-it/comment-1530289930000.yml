message: "Hi @deadlydog, First of all thank you so much for this helpful post! this was EXACTLY what I was looking for!! :). I've created my batch file as well as my PS script. I am calling my PS script by passing in parameters and the values\r\n\r\nPowerShell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command \"&amp; '%PowerShellScriptPath%' -urlPath 'Value1' -serviceName 'Value2'\"\r\n\r\nand my PS script has the parameters defined like below:\r\n param\r\n    (\r\n        [parameter(Mandatory=$true)]\r\n        [string] $urlPath,\r\n\r\n        [parameter(Mandatory=$true)]\r\n        [string] $serviceName\r\n    )\r\n $http = netsh http show urlacl url=$urlPath\r\n    if(-not($http -match $serviceName))\r\n    {\r\n        netsh http add urlacl url=$urlPath sddl=\"D:(A;;GX;;;NS)\"\r\n    }\r\n    else\r\n    {\r\n        Write-Host \"it's there\"\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nFor some reason when I run my batch script, it opens up the command prompt but doesn't actually register the urls. \r\n\r\nAm I passing in the parameters correctly? or is there a way to debug this process?\r\nAgain, thank you in advance for your assistance. You've been a great help so far :)"
