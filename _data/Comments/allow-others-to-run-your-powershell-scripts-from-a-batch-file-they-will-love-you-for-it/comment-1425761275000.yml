I give the code for how to run the script as admin just a few lines below the code that you are using for how to run it normally; just use that Run As Admin method instead to call your PowerShell script:\r\n\r\nPowerShell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command \"& {Start-Process PowerShell -ArgumentList '-NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File \"\"%PowerShellScriptPath%\"\"' -Verb RunAs}\";"
