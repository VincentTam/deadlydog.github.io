  I'm passing through a multiline $DefaultText that's basically notes coming
  from VM's. I'm seeing multilines if I Write-Host $DefaultText inside the
  function. But When the text box is opened the lines are all one single line. 
  If I press ok and output the $multiLineText it looks correct. Is there
  something else I need to do in order to make the multilines show up in
  $DefaultText inside $texBox.Text ?
