message: "<a href=\"#comment-39962\" rel=\"nofollow\">@deadlydog </a> \r\n\r\nNo prob running AHK, and so far, that's my main tool for making  VS easier to use.  \r\nI really like ReSharper, and the folks who make it also make my preferred IDE, IntelliJ IDEA.  Unfortunately, corporate rules prevent me from running it on my laptop.  I would like to implement ReSharper like functionality natively, or though open source plugins or  AHK.   So far, I haven't found VS to have much flexibility when it comes to customization, and online resources haven't been directly on point either.    So any  help into how to wrest fully control of these things from VS is appreciated."
