message: "Hello,\r\nI have an XML file that includes comments (much more readable).  However this is causing havoc with my processing logic.  \r\nPart of the logic uses $SequenceCount = ($CFG.APP.INSTALL.ChildNodes).Count.  \r\nI either need to DELETE comments from the XML object or, alternatively, I need the count to EXCLUDE comments.   Can you help??"
