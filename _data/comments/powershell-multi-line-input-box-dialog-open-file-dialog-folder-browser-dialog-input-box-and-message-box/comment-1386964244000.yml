message: "@deadlydog\r\n\r\nSorry about that. I'm a newbbie by far. I've created a script to add and setup apps within Citrix, but I was looking for something like a popup box to add to the code to answer the questions in the script. Looking at \"Prompt for simple user input\" looks like it will do the trick. What don't understand is how to add that to what I have to input the text in the right field. Can you show an example?"
