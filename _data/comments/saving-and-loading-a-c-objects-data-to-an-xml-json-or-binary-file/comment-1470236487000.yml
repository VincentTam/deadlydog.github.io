message: "I'm pretty sure you've got some code backwards in there in the json usage example.   You are passing the objects to the ReadFromJsonFile as the second argument which throws a compile time error.  Then when calling the WriteToJsonFile method, you're not passing the required objects (person/people).\r\n\r\nHere is the code you have in the example, followed by the correct code...\r\n\r\nJsonSerialization.WriteToJsonFile(\"C:\\person.txt\");\r\nJsonSerialization.WriteToJsonFile&lt;List&gt;(\"C:\\people.txt\");\r\n \r\n// Then in some other function.\r\nPerson person = JsonSerialization.ReadFromJsonFile(\"C:\\person.txt\", person);\r\nList people = JsonSerialization.ReadFromJsonFile&lt;List&gt;(\"C:\\people.txt\", people);\r\n\r\nShould be\r\n\r\nJsonSerialization.WriteToJsonFile(\"C:\\person.txt\",person);\r\nJsonSerialization.WriteToJsonFile&lt;List&gt;(\"C:\\people.txt\", people);\r\n \r\n// Then in some other function.\r\nPerson person = JsonSerialization.ReadFromJsonFile(\"C:\\person.txt\");\r\nList people = JsonSerialization.ReadFromJsonFile&lt;List&gt;(\"C:\\people.txt\")"
