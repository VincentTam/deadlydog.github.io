If package X has developmentDependency set to true in it's nuspec metadata then when I install it into project Y, it should be listed as a developmentDependency in the packages.config of project Y. That, fundamentally, is the new feature in it's entirety. I've been using it since NuGet 2.8 was released and it seems to work just fine."
