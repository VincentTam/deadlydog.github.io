  Hi John, PowerShell v3.0 is required, so that shouldn't be the problem.  This
  "exited with code 1" is a generic "running the batch script failed" error
  message.  The bottom of this page
  (https://newnugetpackage.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=NuGet%20Package%20To%20Create%20A%20NuGet%20Package%20From%20Your%20Project%20After%20Every%20Build)
  shows how to find the real error message.  Can you post that error message
  please.  Also, it might make more sense for you to open an Issue on the
  CodePlex page (https://newnugetpackage.codeplex.com/workitem/list/basic)
  rather than continuing in these comments.  Thanks.
