message: "<a href=\"#comment-582904\" rel=\"nofollow\">@Shweta </a> \r\nIt looks to be a problem with your PowerShell script itself. I assume you get the error just when running the PowerShell script without using the batch file? I would post your question along with some code on StackOverflow.com to see if anybody can help you out."
