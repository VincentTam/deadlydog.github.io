  Hello kind and clever people.


  I need help to run a powershell script in a batch file. I run the powershell
  script manually every single day and I wanted to automate it if possible with
  your help. Note that I am renaming a large number of files.


  this is the script I ran under the command prompt of powershell


  get-childitem TSIL_*.pdf |rename-item -NewName {$_.name -replace ‘^TSIL_’,”}


  the directory is c:\customer\pdf


  my target is to remove the first 5 chars of the filename.


  input filename : TSIL_12345_111_222.pdf

  target output : 12345_111_222.pdf


  I will greatly, appreciate if you can write the code for me or better if you
  have other solution that you can assist with.


  Thank you and god bless!
