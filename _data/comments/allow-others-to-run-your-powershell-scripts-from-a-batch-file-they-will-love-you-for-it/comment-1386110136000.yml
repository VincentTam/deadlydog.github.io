message: "<a href=\"#comment-30569\" rel=\"nofollow\">@Antonio Bueno </a> \r\nYou can definitely do that; it's nice and short :)\r\n\r\nFor my blog posts I try to make things more generalized and easy to understand, as not everybody has the same background knowledge.  I would rather have a few clear lines over a confusing one liner.  Also, your solution has the additional constraint of requiring the .cmd and .ps1 files to have the same name, which some people may not want.\r\n\r\nThanks for the tip though!"
